# ETL Project - Happiness & Life Expectancy 

The ETL project involved Extracting, Transforming and Loading various datasets to
ensure the data is clean, complete and usable for reporting and analysis. ETL is an 
essential process as it allows for the communication between multiple data sources,
merging them into a centralized location.

Our group aimed to explore the happiness rankings of countries across the world,
focusing on specific factors such as the freedom to make life choices, social
support and GDP per capita. In addition, we investigated the life expectancy
rankings of countries worldwide. Our two datasets were utilized from the public
platform, Kaggle.

Further analysis can be performed to determine any correlations between happiness
factors and countries with higher life expectancies.
